		 <p>Hello! My name is Ariana. I'm a freshman at BMCC, I'm current studying Animation and Motion Graphic. I have heard stories from people who suffered from anxiety and it makes me so happy to know others feel the same way about anxiety. I have been told that anxiety isn't serious and that people should just get over it. If only if it were that easy, I would have done it a long time ago. I wanted to share my experiences in hope that people will understand that it is a very serious issue a lot of people especially young adults suffer through. It shouldn't be taken lightly. Here are some useful resources to help better understand anxiety. Thank you for visting!</p>
