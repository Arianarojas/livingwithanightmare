		<h1><center>Living with a Nightmare</center></h1> 

		<p>Everyone has dealt with anxiety. Whether it be worrying about a test, job interview, a first date, etc. But how about...having to worry nonstop, 24/7, no matter how badly you want it to stop. I know that feeling too well. I'm always worrying about something, someone, anything, every single day. I call it "A Living Nightmare." My anxiety always gets the better of me and can ruin my whole day. There are three main symptoms I constantly suffer through when my anxiety starts acting up. I would like to share that with you. To help you picture what I go through, I made some gifs!</p>
